            <title>[IO-33] [io] Addition of FileSystemUtils class</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IO-33</link>
                <project id="12310477" key="IO">Commons IO</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;First, let me say that this is my first Bugzilla submission of any kind &lt;br/&gt;
anywhere, so if I did something wrong I apologize in advance, and I&apos;d &lt;br/&gt;
appreciate a kind nudge in the right direction &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.gif&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That aside, this is a follow-up to a submission I made on the Commons &lt;br/&gt;
Developer list.  I submitted a function called getFreeSpace() that allows for &lt;br/&gt;
getting the free space on a drive or volume in a cross-platform nature, &lt;br/&gt;
something that is missing from Java at this point.  There seemed to be at &lt;br/&gt;
least some support for this (IIRC, one +1 and one conditional +1), but Stephen &lt;br/&gt;
Colebourne suggested it be part of a new FileSystemUtils class.  I have &lt;br/&gt;
created this class and it is available for download at the referenced URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Stephen suggested, I cleaned up the code and tried to make it adhere to the &lt;br/&gt;
other Commons IO code (although it&apos;s not my own preferred coding style, so I &lt;br/&gt;
could be off a bit in spots).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not attempt to make a unit test for it for two reasons... (1) I have no &lt;br/&gt;
experience creating JUnit tests, although I would have tried except for (2) I &lt;br/&gt;
didn&apos;t really see a way to test this.  My original post on the mailing list &lt;br/&gt;
included a test harness app that just took in a drive or volume name on the &lt;br/&gt;
command line and displayed the free space.  Someone would have to manually &lt;br/&gt;
compare that result to what their OS reported, but aside from that I&apos;m not &lt;br/&gt;
sure how a test could be written for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen also had a question regarding use cases for this.  I gave him two or &lt;br/&gt;
three, but only one seemed convincing, so let me state it here as well...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an application has to copy files to a volume, or create a file or series of &lt;br/&gt;
files, it is very helpful to know before hand if that operation will fail or &lt;br/&gt;
not, especially if it has to be an all-or-nothing operation.  This code will &lt;br/&gt;
allow for that.  The alternative is to have exceptions thrown when the copy or &lt;br/&gt;
create operations fail, and then clean up whatever did manage to get copied or &lt;br/&gt;
created.  That&apos;s an obviously ugly solution.  In some cases it could even be a &lt;br/&gt;
rather drastic problem: imagine creating a file on a server and running the &lt;br/&gt;
volume out of space.  We all know what can happen in that case: all sorts of &lt;br/&gt;
general nastiness!  Better to be able to tell before hand if you have enough &lt;br/&gt;
space or not.  This code allows you to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please feel free to contact me at fzammetti@omnytex.com if I can be of any &lt;br/&gt;
further help getting this added to Commons IO, assuming enough committers &lt;br/&gt;
agree it&apos;s a good addition.  Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
